All notable changes to BantayNiMama are recorded here.

versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

> **Claude: add an entry under `[Unreleased]` whenever you complete a feature, fix a bug, change
> the schema, or add/remove a dependency.** Reference requirement IDs (`SR-`, `TR-`, `NFR-`) so the
> entry ties back to `PROJECT_SPECS.md`. Do not write an entry for pure refactors that change no
> behaviour.
